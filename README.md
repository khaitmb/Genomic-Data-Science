### Genomic Data Science

#### Python
[File](https://github.com/khaitmb/Python-for-Genomic-Data-Science/blob/main/README.md) containing code that answers the following questions regarding a DNA sequence containing FASTA file:
- How many records are in the file?
- What are the lengths of the sequences in the file? What is the longest sequence and what is the shortest sequence? Is there more than one longest or shortest sequence? What are their identifiers?
- Identify all ORFs present in each sequence of the FASTA file. What is the length of the longest ORF in the file? What is the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF? For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that identifier? What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it?
